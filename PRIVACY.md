The Horse64 tooling **doesn't collect any private info
about you** on its own, other than whatever you actively
make it store via your own actions and tweaks, like for
example if you write code to collect private info or if
you decide to sign code versions with a private e-mail.

But you can use some tools for networking activites. If
you do, you're likely **subject to the privacy policy of
the target servers** you're making it connect to.
